Reminders to self for updating the site

# Until all articles are populated there must be no links to non-populated ones.
When an issue is being populated include its ID to the following pages:
1. author.php
2. category.php
3. tag.php

# When a new issue is being added I need to:
1. treat the new issue as unpopulated (no links to its articles)
2. Update the $last_issue at front-page.php
